Data Science and Web Scraping Project
Overview
This project encompasses multiple tasks related to data science and web scraping. It includes SQL queries, web scraping for laptop data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training for price prediction, and extraction of design elements from a website.

Task 1: SQL Queries
Problem 1: Students and Salaries
Objective: Write a query to find the names of students whose friends received higher salary offers than them. The results should be ordered by the salary offered to their best friends.

Approach:

Join the Students, Friends, and Packages tables.
Compare the salaries of the students with their friends.
Select the names of students whose friends have higher salaries.
Order the results by the friends' salaries.
Problem 2: Swap Name and Marks
Objective: Write a SQL query to swap the Name and Marks values between rows with odd and even IDs. The ID values must remain unchanged.

Approach:

Use a self-join to match odd IDs with the subsequent even IDs.
Swap the Name and Marks values between these matched rows.
Task 2: Web Scraping Laptop Data
Objective: Scrape laptop data from a website (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Reliance) including specifications, warranty details, and price. Collect data for at least 1500 laptops.

Approach:

Use Selenium to navigate the website and extract laptop data.
Extract details such as title, price, specifications, and warranty information.
Store the scraped data in a CSV file.
Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training
EDA and Data Cleaning
Objective: Perform EDA on the scraped laptop data and clean it for further analysis.

Approach:

Load the data and inspect its structure and summary statistics.
Clean the price column and extract relevant features (RAM, storage, processor type) from the specifications.
Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships.
Statistical Insights
Objective: Derive statistical insights from the EDA.

Insights:

Distribution of laptop prices.
Price comparison across different processor types.
Relationship between RAM and price.
Correlation between price, RAM, and storage.
Model Training
Objective: Train a model to predict laptop prices based on specifications and optimize it.

Approach:

Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.
Train regression models to predict laptop prices.
Optimize the models using techniques such as grid search.
Evaluate the models and visualize feature importance.
Task 4: Web Design Element Extraction
Objective: Extract design elements (logo, primary colors, button colors) from a given website and recommend a complementary button color.

Approach:

Use web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium) to extract the logo image URL.
Identify primary colors used on the website by analyzing CSS and HTML.
Extract button colors from the website's design.
Recommend a button color that complements the primary colors.
Deliverables:

URLs or paths to the logo image(s).
List of primary colors in hex format.
List of button colors in hex format.
Recommendation for a complementary button color.
